   1- parimeterized constructors ------- No we cannot make it or use it with friend keywoord
   2- default  constructors ------- No we cannot make it or use it with friend keywoord
   3-  copy constructors ------- No we cannot make it or use it with friend keywoord
   4- this pointer ----------- no we cannot use this pointer with friend keyword as they both serve different purposses
    ) 
Static keyword(
    1- constructors [no we cannot use them together]
    2- this [no we cannot use static with this keyword]
    3- function [ yes we can make as static function ]
    4- friends function [no we cannot use both keyword togather done in static cpp file]
    )
const keyword( file practice_const
    1- constructors [no we cannot do that as cpp dosenot allow us to make constructor const ]
    2- functions [yes we can make function const]
    3- friends [no we cannot make friend function const reson in cpp file ]
    4- static []
