//Linked list is sa data structure containing many nodes 
// a node contain data and address of next data 

//Why we use it?

//Arrays are not expandable

//--> vectors are dynamic so they are expandable but when an array is full to add more values another array isa created to copy these and store more but storage consuming 
// while linked list are better 

//--> Linked list = Dynamic data structures
//--> can shrink expand

//Head is a pointer containing adress of first node data and nex contain adress of next node data

// // ------>> TYPES of Linked lists 
//-->1- singly 
//-->2- Doubly
//-->3- Circular
