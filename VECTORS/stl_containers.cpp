//--> container --> object which stores data
//-->Algorithm procedure to process data--> like sorting and other things  
//-->itrators object which point to an element in container--> these are objects which helps algorithm by pointing towards data in container

//CONTAINERS
//1--> sEQUENCE container -- add data in linear fashion
            //Vector -->Random access fast --> insertion deletion fast at the end while in middle slow --> elements are next to each other
            //List  --> Random Access slow --> every element is placed i different location and first element contain adress of second and seccond contain adress of third and so on, so its difficult to know any random element
            //Deque 
//2--> Assossiative container --> Direct acces--> not linear
//2--> Derived container--> for modeling of real world
